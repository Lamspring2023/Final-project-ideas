# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A Swordsman journey

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game similar to Vampire Survivors

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use unreal engine to make the game. It will be single player and possibly multiplayer later on. the feature it would have is it game mechanics. People like vampire survivors and there are many different games similar to it. It would be executed on the computer.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

by myself

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will like to a basic start like have a character moving in cardinal directions, attackable enemies and a upgrade system.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having a multi upgrade system and different enemies and combination weapons.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is a full function game with different characters and enrage system.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will start with the character and movement. Then proceed with the weapons and the enemies. Then I can work on the other details like other weapons and different enemies. I will research about different game mechnamics like area where enemies can get hit. Then finally I will work on the finishing touches like different characters and stuff.
