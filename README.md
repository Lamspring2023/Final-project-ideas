This is my final project

I love this project. Since it allows us to show our creativity with our computerscience skills.
Unity was made is C# so that was a little bit difficult.
Each section had it own problem.
Like the character was behind other things or the coding was wrong and a lot of troubleshooting was made.
I used tutorials on how to make some of these things.
I hit a few walls but went overthem in the end.
Even though it wasn't a perfect project I am really proud of what have I done.
